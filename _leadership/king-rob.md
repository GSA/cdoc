Rob King is an award-winning data, analytics, and systems executive with over 20 years of experience leading multi-disciplinary teams of data scientists, data engineers, analysts, and software developers. Rob was appointed as the Chief Data Officer (CDO) for the Department of Energy (DOE) in July 2023. Prior to this position, he served as the Chief Data Officer and Associate Commissioner for the Office of Analytics and Improvements at the Social Security Administration (SSA). He came to DOE with a wealth of data and analytics management experience in both the public and private sectors. While as the SSA CDO, and prior to that at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), he led enterprise-wide data management and governance strategies across multiple business intelligence, data stewardship, and advanced analytics programs. He has also led several agency-wide C-level executive steering committees at these agencies related to data management and governance maturation initiatives. Rob was appointed by OMB as the Vice Chair of the Federal CDO Council in January 2024.  

Prior to his public service career, Rob spent 10+ years in private industry as an IT systems architect, implementer, and integrator serving multiple Fortune 500 companies and cabinet-level agencies. During this time, he specialized in maturing software applications and integrating business processes across diverse functions to achieve strategic objectives for his customers. In summary, Rob has spent his career coordinating and leading strategies for consolidating and integrating data from across disparate lines of business and positioning it to drive integrated, meaningful analysis for evidence-based decision-making by business leaders - outcomes he hopes to replicate at DOE.

Rob holds a bachelor's degree from Stockton University and a master's degree from the Naval Postgraduate School. His master's thesis, titled "DHS's Pursuit of Data Driven DecisionÂ­ Making," studied the alignment of technology to the culture, policies, processes, and human reward systems within a complex agency (DHS). He also holds multiple professional certifications, including PMP and ITIL.

When not involved in the throes of the data management and governance world, he enjoys finding ways to get physically active with his family, either through camping, fishing, and hiking, or by coaching his daughter's sports teams and getting involved in Boy Scout activities with his son.
