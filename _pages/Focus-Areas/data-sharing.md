### Overview
The Data Sharing Working Group is responsible for creating a comprehensive list of data sharing purposes and use cases at federal agencies. This group also works to document data sharing challenges and solutions, and recommend actions that would make sharing easier with strong privacy protections including legal challenges, policy challenges, technical challenges (e.g., preserving semantics across boundaries) and measurement challenges (e.g., how to measure value of sharing). This group also aims to  identify solutions and recommended actions that would make sharing easier with strong  privacy protections, including legislative and policy changes, best or promising practices and input to the Advisory Committee on data for evidence building. 
### Why this matters to the CDO Council?
Data sharing is important to effectively managing data and can also help optimize outputs, increase the impact of research, and support open data inquiry.
This working groupâ€™s efforts are also critical to implementing the Federal Data Strategy.
