### Overview:
The COVID-19 pandemic highlights the importance of using data and collaborating across the government.  Sharing lessons learned, resources, and data challenges is critical to advancing our ability to support agency decision making - both in mission achievement and how COVID-19 impacts the Federal workforce.  Additionally, agency representatives can strengthen their own analytics efforts, frameworks, and methodologies by leveraging and integrating knowledge from their counterparts across government.

### Why this Matters to the CDO Council:
To effectively and efficiently respond to emergency situations, like the Coronavirus pandemic, it is critical that the CDO has the structure and tools in place to facilitate a whole-of-government approach to data-informed decisions on impacts, tracking, and COVID-19 issues such as reopening plans. This focus area helps enable this approach by establishing an effective means for cross-government collaboration on its COVID-19 response and also helps better posture agencies for future disasters or emergencies.
