### Why this matters to the CDO Council
The <a href="https://strategy.data.gov/">Federal Data Strategy</a> and the Federal Chief Data Officers Council share a vision to lead transformational change that improves the nation’s ability to leverage data as a strategy asset.  The Chief Data Officers Council and the CDOs have a critical role in the policies and implementations of the Federal Data Strategy.  The Council supports CDOs learning about policy developments, sharing best practices and collaboratively working on shared challenges. The Council also partners with OMB and other CXO councils to  identify cross-cutting opportunities that the Councils can solve most effectively together.
