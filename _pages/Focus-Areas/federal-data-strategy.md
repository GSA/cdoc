### Overview
The use of data is transforming the world. The way the Federal Government provides, maintains, and uses data has a unique place in society, and maintaining trust in Federal data is pivotal to a democratic process. To meet the changing role of data and needs of democracy, the Federal Government created a coordinated and integrated data strategy that better enables data to deliver on mission, serve the public, and steward resources while respecting privacy and confidentiality.  The mission of the <a href="https://strategy.data.gov/">Federal Data Strategy</a> is to fully leverage the value of federal data for mission, service, and the public good by guiding the Federal Government in practicing ethical governance, conscious design, and a learning culture.

### Why this matters to the CDO Council:
The <a href="https://strategy.data.gov/">Federal Data Strategy</a> and the Federal Chief Data Officers Council share a vision to lead transformational change that improves the nationâ€™s ability to leverage data as a strategy asset.  The Chief Data Officers Council and the CDOs have a critical role in the policies and implementations of the <a href="https://strategy.data.gov/">Federal Data Strategy</a>.  The Council supports CDOs learning about policy developments, sharing best practices and collaboratively working on shared challenges. The Council also partners with OMB and other CXO councils to  identify cross-cutting opportunities that the Councils can solve most effectively together.
