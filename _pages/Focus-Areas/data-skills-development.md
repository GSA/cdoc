### Purpose

Part of the Federal Data Strategyâ€™s (FDS) Action 4 (Identify Opportunities to Increase Staff Data Skills) is the need to develop a strategy to close any skills gap a Department, Bureau or Agency identifies. A component of this is training current staff. The Federal government has many efforts underway related to workforce training. A Workforce Development Working Group provides a forum to:

* bring expertise together from across the Federal government, including other inter-agency councils;

* exchange lessons learned and expertise, including the process of developing a training program, and;

* provide support to organizations as they develop their programs.
