### Overview
There is a growing need to advance all levels of data acumen throughout the federal workforce.  Federal agencies can significantly benefit from collaboration in the development and implementation of data skills & workforce development. Networking and sharing experiences related to data skills & workforce development efforts will accelerate implementation of these related endeavors across government. 
 
### Why this matters to the CDO Council

Additionally, it supports actionable, ongoing and competency based data skills and workforce development, resulting in improving data acumen and closing skills/development gaps to successfully cross-collaborate across government.
