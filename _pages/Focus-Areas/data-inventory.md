purpose: Data inventories are as essential to agencies as card catalogs are to libraries. These inventories make data assets discoverable to machines and humans. To inform policy decisions, CDO’s must ensure their data inventories support their agency missions.

<div id="m-a2" class="usa-accordion__content">
  <p>The Data Skills & Workforce Development Working Group supports all of the goals of the Council by supporting and identifying federal data skills & workforce development to improve data acumen across the Council. Improving agency data inventories will increase the value of federal data assets. Data standards, and metadata standards specifically, are the subject of great attention in both the Evidence Act and Geospatial Data Act. The World Wide Web Consortium’s (W3C) industry-adopted standards (e.g., schema.org and Data Catalog Vocabulary (DCAT) offer immense potential as a starting point for the working group.</p>
