                    <p class="font-sans-md">The Federal Aviation Administration's UAS Operations Team, AJW-124, is leveraging the remote sensing capabilities of Small UAS (sUAS) technologies to augment maintenance operations, infrastructure inspections, engineering assessments, troubleshooting coverage and line of sight problems, and siting of new towers in the National Airspace System (NAS). The team was able to demonstrate the use of remote sensing capabilities of small drones in tandem with Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to deliver a new ecosystem of capabilities to drive organizational business intelligence. The visualization of data products enabled maintenance and engineering assessments on NAS infrastructure to be completed safer (no physical climbs), more efficient (less time and personnel), and more thorough (high resolution imagery of places easily missed with the naked eye).</p>

                    <p class="font-sans-md">In 2022, Nicholas Buggs and Joshua Spicka led an effort to establish a Data Stewardship community across the agency. This included the creation of the Data Steward role, the identification of potential Data stewards, the validation of Data Stewards in all offices and regions, and the training of Data Stewards with respect to their responsibilities in this role. This effort has established a platform through which data governance best practices and standards can be communicated and agency wide collaboration around data can occur. The role of every office and region in managing data as a strategic asset has now been reinforced and the agency has taken a significant step forward in its efforts to unite around data.</p>

                    <p class="font-sans-md">“Operation Welcome Nica” successfully brought together multiple Federal, State, and civil society partners to support the arrival of the 222 Nicaraguan political prisoner parolees in safety and dignity. The data and analytics team at State lead by Tressa Finerty, S/ES Deputy Executive Secretary, was considered a central component to the success of this operation and was one of the first offices called upon to support the crisis operation. The data collected by this State-led operation was shared and used by interagency partners including the White House NSC, the Office of the Vice President, DHS, HHS, parolee destination states, and partner NGOs. By placing data at the core of its operations and anticipating the need to effectively collect, manage, and report data between February 9 and February 14, 2022, the broader “Operation Welcome Nica” resulted in a safe and dignified arrival in the U.S. of 222 political prisoners from Nicaragua.</p>

This team from the ED Office of the Chief Data Officer led the work on Goal 2 throughout 2022 and, through their efforts, dramatically advanced data skills development to fundamentally empower ED employees, advancing strategic data use across the agency. One of their 2022 accomplishments included the deployment of the ED Data Competency Framework with four competencies (Data Program, Data Operations, Data Analysis, and Advancing the Use of Data) and 16 sub competencies at five proficiency levels. Another accomplishment included the launch of the first ED Data Science Training Program, graduating 28 new data scientists from 11 ED offices who will apply their skills within their areas of domain expertise. Through these and other efforts, the Department of Education has cultivated a sustainable resource that will support strategic use of data for years to come and did so by prioritizing the Department’s most valuable asset—its dedicated staff.</p>

                    <p class="font-sans-md">As the federal lead for the National Address Database initiative (NAD) at the Department of Transportation (DOT), Mr. Lewis has embraced a distributed data governance model. The initiative is a true partnership effort, where local and tribal governments are recognized as the authoritative source for the address points that comprise the NAD. In most cases, the local and tribal data is rolled up to the state government level and then submitted to the NAD by state partners. To date, the NAD includes 38 state partners (including the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico), 30 of which have submitted data. In states with restricted data or no address programs, the NAD has 28 county and 2 tribal partners. Mr. Lewis works with each partner to establish update frequencies based on their processes and publishes a new release of the NAD every 3 months. The latest release contained 65.3 million records.</p>

Over the last fiscal year, the team developed robust policies that operationalize data down to the lowest level of the DAF. With a budget of less than $80M, the number of operational users the CDO enabled was approximately 20K (total cost per user $4,000) across two data platforms with the DAF and also Joint partners in OSD Advana and the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center. Due to the team&apos;s successes, the Under Secretary of the Air Force charged the office with a Data Investment Review to ensure the DAF remains operationally relevant. The team increased its total business capture in the DAF program by over 600%. Furthermore, the team&apos;s proven capabilities led the DAF personnel management community, AF/A1, to partner with their data platforms in order to modernize their personnel management data systems; the total value of the 33 month sprint between the AF/A1 and CDO is $1.6M.</p>

                    <p class="font-sans-md">The interagency Wildland Fire Fuels Data Management team utilized groundbreaking knowledge graph tools to facilitate efficient interagency data governance that promotes understanding and coordination between partners. The Fuels Knowledge Graph Project focused on glossaries and key reference data to support the coordination of hazardous fuel reduction activities. The flexibility of the knowledge graph allows all partners to define and describe their vocabularies and data, including business rules for collection and use and the relationships between data from multiple sources. The use of common reference data sets enables more consistency across partners. The team coordinated with the states of CA, UT, NV, and TX to ensure non-federal representation. They also identified source data from USGS, OMB, OPM, and Treasury to promote the value of authoritative data sources and linked open data principles.
