                    <p class="font-sans-md"><strong><em>Shawn Tufts, Jay Gregory, Seth Hasty, Eli Velazquez , Department of Transportation (CFO):</em></strong></p>
                    <p class="font-sans-md" style='text-indent:.5in;'>The Federal Aviation Administration's UAS Operations Team, AJW-124, is leveraging the remote sensing capabilities of Small UAS (sUAS) technologies to augment maintenance operations, infrastructure inspections, engineering assessments, troubleshooting coverage and line of sight problems, and siting of new towers in the National Airspace System (NAS). The team was able to demonstrate the use of remote sensing capabilities of small drones in tandem with Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to deliver a new ecosystem of capabilities to drive organizational business intelligence. The visualization of data products enabled maintenance and engineering assessments on NAS infrastructure to be completed safer (no physical climbs), more efficient (less time and personnel), and more thorough (high resolution imagery of places easily missed with the naked eye).</p>
                    <p class="font-sans-md" style='text-align:center;'><strong><u>Excellence in Data Governance</u></strong></p>                
                    <p class="font-sans-md"><strong><em>Ms. Erycka Reid , Department of the Air Force (CFO):</em></strong></p>
                    <p class="font-sans-md" style='text-indent:.5in;'>Ms. Erycka Reid is an exemplary leader in data governance, she led a 13-person team providing Data and AI Strategic Services to a 700K+ member enterprise. Additionally, she successfully prepared the Data Battlespace with strategy, governance, and policy that directly increased the Department of the Air Force Data and AI capability to drive Enterprise Domain Awareness. Ms. Reid's proactive approach enabled her team to develop quantifiable measures for success and metrics for accountability for delivering ambitious results across the enterprise. In addition, her efforts established the DAF Data and Artificial Intelligence Council, which provides oversight and resourcing of the DAF DSE and DAF Data Fabric production to deliver Enterprise Domain Awareness.</p>
                    <p class="font-sans-md"><strong><em>Nicholas Buggs and Joshua Spicka (Team) , Nuclear Regulatory Commission (CFO):</em></strong></p>
                    <p class="font-sans-md" style='text-indent:.5in;'>In 2022, Nicholas Buggs and Joshua Spicka led an effort to establish a Data Stewardship community across the agency. This included the creation of the Data Steward role, the identification of potential Data stewards, the validation of Data Stewards in all offices and regions, and the training of Data Stewards with respect to their responsibilities in this role. This effort has established a platform through which data governance best practices and standards can be communicated and agency wide collaboration around data can occur. The role of every office and region in managing data as a strategic asset has now been reinforced and the agency has taken a significant step forward in its efforts to unite around data.</p>
                    <p class="font-sans-md" style='text-align:center;'><strong><u>Team of the Year</u></strong></p>                  
                    <p class="font-sans-md"><strong><em>Operation Welcome Nica, Department of State (CFO):</em></strong></p>
                    <p class="font-sans-md" style='text-indent:.5in;'>"Operation Welcome Nica" successfully brought together multiple Federal, State, and civil society partners to support the arrival of the 222 Nicaraguan political prisoner parolees in safety and dignity. U.S. The data and analytics team at State lead by Tressa Finerty, S/ES Deputy Executive Secretary, was considered a central component to the success of this operation and was one of the first offices called upon to support the crisis operation. The data collected by this State-led operation was shared and used by interagency partners including the White House NSC, the Office of the Vice President, DHS, HHS, parolee destination states, and partner NGOs. By placing data at the core of its operations and anticipating the need to effectively collect, manage, and report data between February 9 and February 14, 2022, the broader “Operation Welcome Nica” resulted in a safe and dignified arrival in the U.S. of 222 political prisoners from Nicaragua.</p>
                    <p class="font-sans-md" style='text-align:center;'><strong><u>Data Champion of the Year</u></strong></p>                    
                    <p class="font-sans-md"><strong><em>John Stevens, Federal Reserve System (Non-CFO):</em></strong></p>
                    <p class="font-sans-md" style='text-indent:.5in;'>John Stevens, the senior associate director at the Research & Statistics division of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors (the Board), has been a great data champion at the Board. John became the first vice chair of the Board Data Council, a data governance body that consists of data leaders and practitioners from all Board’s divisions. He and the CDO, along with the support of the Board Data Council, developed the first Board Data Strategy at the enterprise level. He was one of the critical initiators to establish a new program to improve the Board data download program to better share the Board's published data and engage with the Broader public data users.</p>
                    <p class="font-sans-md"><strong><em>Andrea Palm , HHS (CFO):</em></strong></p>
                    <p class="font-sans-md" style='text-indent:.5in;'>Deputy Secretary Andrea Palm has demonstrated an exceptional commitment to increasing data capacity at HHS and applying data for better, faster decision-making. In mid-2022, Deputy Secretary Palm convened a 10-person cross-agency team - including leaders from the Immediate Office of the Secretary and Office of the Chief Information Officer - to develop and implement a data strategy for the Department. She also ensured that a diverse group of over 150 stakeholders were engaged, including program and data leaders at each of HHS' operating divisions; representatives from private industry, nonprofit organizations, academia, and state and local governments; as well as experts in data policy and systems. The resulting vision, priorities, and initiatives enjoy widespread support within the organization at every level.</p>
                    <p class="font-sans-md" style='text-align:center;'><strong><u>Distinguished Achievement in Federal Data</u></strong></p>                   
                    <p class="font-sans-md"><strong><em>Katherine Tom, Federal Reserve System (Non-CFO):</em></strong></p>
                    <p class="font-sans-md" style='text-indent:.5in;'>Katherine Tom has served as the Federal Reserve Board of Governors (FRB) Chief Data Officer for two years. She developed critical objectives informed by Federal Data initiatives in transforming Office of the Chief Data Officer and promoting data governance and data management best practices. She built great collaborative relationships with the Federal Reserve System data management community and played critical leadership roles on several enterprise data initiatives through which she leveraged strategic vision and strengths in translating the data strategic vision into concrete operating plans.</p>
                    <p class="font-sans-md"><strong><em>Sharon Boivin, Layne Morrison, Soumya Sathya , Department of Education (CFO):</em></strong></p>
                    <p class="font-sans-md" style='text-indent:.5in;'>The Department of Education (ED) prioritized Goal 2: Building Human Capacity to Leverage Data in its inaugural Data Strategy and has since been recognized as a pioneer, promoting an exceptional data culture and community while sharing its innovations through the CDOC. This team from the ED Office of the Chief Data Officer (OCDO) led the work on Goal 2 throughout 2022 and, through their efforts, dramatically advanced data skills development to fundamentally empower ED employees, advancing strategic data use across the agency. Some of their 2022 accomplishments were Deployment of the ED Data Competency Framework with four competencies (Data Program, Data Operations, Data Analysis, and Advancing the Use of Data) and 16 sub competencies at five proficiency levels. As well as the launch of the first ED Data Science Training Program, graduating 28 new data scientists from 11 ED offices who will apply their skills within their areas of domain expertise.</p>
