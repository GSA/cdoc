      <h2>Symposium Overview:</h2>
      <p>
        Our attendees had the opportunity to discover the transformative power of data 
        in modernizing agency missions and enhancing organizational capabilities. 
        Federal leaders shared exclusive insights on how data drives mission delivery 
        transformation and unlocks untapped potential. Participants also gained a deeper 
        understanding of how the alignment of AI and data management can unleash sustained 
        and responsible value within federal agencies. Please see below for more information 
        regarding the agenda, including the special speakers who provided great insights and discussion.

      <h2>What is the CDO Council?</h2>
      <p>
        The Federal Chief Data Officers (CDO) Council was established by the
        <a
          href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/4174/text"
          >Foundations for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act</a
        >, which also requires all federal agencies to appoint a CDO.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The Councilâ€™s vision is to improve government mission achievement and
          increase the benefits to the Nation through improvement in the
          management, use, protection, dissemination, and generation of data in
          government decision-making and operations.
        </li>
        <li>
          The CDO Council has 90+ member CDOs from across the Federal
          government, as well as representatives from OMB, and other key
          councils and committees.
        </li>
        <li>
          The CDO Council has working groups that focus on critical topics and
          committees that help agencies connect and collaborate. The CDO Council
          also works with other interagency councils on data related topics and
          activities.
        </li>
        <li>
          The CDO Council engages with the public and private users of
          Government data to improve data practices and access to data assets.
