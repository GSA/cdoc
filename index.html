Welcome to official Federalist Jekyll template for the U.S Web Design System 2.0

You'll notice that this page only makes reference to two other html files: hero.html and highlights.html

To the edit the home page, you can edit those files directly, create new ones or add content directly to
this page. 

We recommend splitting apart your site's components into their own smaller section so that its easier to 
manage in the long term.
