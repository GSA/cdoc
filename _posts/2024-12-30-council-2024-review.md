With 2024 drawing to a close and as we anticipate the excitement of what is to come in the new year, Rob and I find it fitting to reflect on our time as a Council and celebrate the many successes that have marked the year.

In collaboration with the three other Evidence Act Councils, the CDO Council launched into the new year by co-hosting the Evidence Act 5th Anniversary Celebration, a collaborative event exploring the Act's impact, history, and the future of evidence in the Federal Government. Shortly after, the Council held its first annual strategic session with our newly appointed Executive Committee members, including Rob and me, who assumed our roles as Vice Chair and Chair in January 2024, respectively. This strategic session was an opportunity for the Committee to create a blueprint for future Council initiatives, goals, and objectives, as well as to review mandated requirements and current goals and objectives to help shape the new strategic vision of the Council. With the transition to a new Executive Committee, we celebrated a well-deserved retirement for our former Executive Committee members and Chairs.
This year marked a period of dynamic engagement and growth within our community. Early in the year, the National Gallery of Art data team opened its doors for the CDO Council, offering an insightful tour of the gallery's data collection methods. As the year progressed, our Council experienced a significant increase in engagement through expanding our working groups, including introducing two new working groups: <a href="https://www.cdo.gov/business-of-data/" target="_blank">Business of Data</a> and <a href="https://www.cdo.gov/data-culture-for-the-workforce/" target="_blank">Data Culture for the Workforce.</a> The latter built upon the foundation of our previous working groups, Data Skills and Data Ethics and Equity, to publish a <a href="https://community.connect.gov/x/6Hcli" target="_blank">Data Science Position Description Library</a>
 to support talent acquisition. Additionally, in partnership with our team at the Department of Education, we hosted a series of social hour events, fostering informal yet impactful networking and engagement opportunities within our community. The pinnacle of our collective efforts came with our highly anticipated annual CDO Council retreat, held in Capon Springs, WV. This retreat was a vital milestone, providing an exceptional opportunity to cultivate collaboration and strategic planning. Coming out of this retreat, we established a cadre of speakers for speaking engagements to represent the CDO Council that will spread awareness far beyond the borders of the Federal data community. 
This year, the Council made substantial progress towards key deliverables, demonstrating our commitment to advancing our mission and strengthening our community. In partnership with OMB and named agencies of the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/10/30/executive-order-on-the-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-development-and-use-of-artificial-intelligence/" target="_blank">AI EO 14110,</a>
 the CDO Council developed initial AI Security Guidelines and submitted them to OMB for further action. We look forward to these guidelines' next steps in the upcoming year. In addition to this vital initiative, the Council delivered on three significant milestones, including the <a href="https://www.cio.gov/assets/files/Zero-Trust-Data-Security-Guide_Oct24-Final.pdf" target="_blank">Zero Trust Security Guide,</a> <a href="https://doi-do.github.io/dcat-us/" target="_blank">FAIRness Project,</a> and the <a href="https://resources.data.gov/assets/documents/CDO_Hiring_A_Data_Scientist_508.pdf" target="_blank">Data Science Hiring Toolkit.</a>
 These phenomenal achievements represent groundbreaking success for the Council. They will serve as critical tools in guiding the community toward the next phase of achieving the Council's goals.

We prioritize collaboration with our ex-officio members and interagency Council representatives through regular Council-to-Council briefs at our monthly Full Council meetings. These presentations provide an invaluable platform for exchanging ideas, sharing perspectives, and gaining insights that drive our initiatives forward. Their unique expertise and contributions are crucial in ensuring the Council operates efficiently and purposefully. In addition, the Council conducted its annual survey to assess the state of our CDOs, gathering essential feedback and data to inform future decisions and strategies. This yearâ€™s survey highlighted several pivotal trends that reflect the changing role of CDOs and the agencies they serve, including a special topic on Data Strategies Support of Artificial Intelligence (AI) Strategies. See the detailed analysis <a href="https://www.cdo.gov/cdo-council-2024-survey/" target="_blank">here</a>. This ongoing commitment to assessment and collaboration underscores our dedication to continuous growth and impactful leadership.

All of our operations in 2024 came together in a defining moment with the launch of the <a href="https://www.cdo.gov/cdo-council-2024-survey/" target="_blank">CDO Council's first-ever Symposium,</a> marking a momentous milestone in our efforts. This event highlighted our commitment to innovation and collaboration. It showcased our ability to unite diverse government, industry, civil society, and academia stakeholders. The Symposium's theme, Data Powers Mission: Transforming Business and Mission with Data, was a powerful platform for exploring how data transforms agency missions and enhances organizational capabilities. Federal leaders shared exclusive insights on how data operations drive mission delivery transformation and unlock untapped potential. This event provided a unique opportunity for participants to engage in critical discussions on the role of data in modernizing government operations and driving the mission of public service forward. The success of this Symposium marks a key achievement in our efforts to foster collaboration and leverage data-driven solutions to create lasting impact across federal agencies.

Reflecting on the milestones we have achieved throughout 2024, Rob and I are proud of the collective efforts that have shaped our progress. Each success, from expanding our working groups to fostering meaningful partnerships and delivering impactful tools, has brought us closer to achieving our vision. The dedication and collaboration of every member has been instrumental in driving our mission forward. As we move into the new year, we remain committed to building on these accomplishments, embracing new opportunities, and continuing to lead with innovation and purpose. Together, as a Council with a thriving Executive Leadership Team, we are poised to achieve even greater success in the year ahead.
