As the year progressed, our Council experienced a significant increase in engagement through expanding our working groups, including introducing two new working groups: [Business of Data](https://www.cdo.gov/business-of-data/) and [Data Culture for the Workforce](https://www.cdo.gov/data-culture-for-the-workforce/). The Data Culture for the Workforce Working Group published a [Data Science Position Description Library](https://community.connect.gov/x/6Hcli) to support talent acquisition.

This year, the Council made substantial progress towards key deliverables, demonstrating our commitment to advancing our mission and strengthening our community.  The CDO Council developed initial AI Security Guidelines and submitted them to OMB for further action. We look forward to these guidelines' next steps in the upcoming year. In addition to this vital initiative, the Council delivered on three significant milestones, including the [Zero Trust Security Guide](https://www.cio.gov/assets/files/Zero-Trust-Data-Security-Guide_Oct24-Final.pdf), [FAIRness Project](https://doi-do.github.io/dcat-us/), and the Data Science Hiring Toolkit.
