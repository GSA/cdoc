The CDO Council now has an awards program!

The purpose of the awards program is to recognize both civilian and military employees of federal agencies that demonstrate innovative data practices to advance government mission achievement and increase the benefits to the Nation through improvement in the management, use, protection, dissemination, and generation of data in government decision-making and operations. Nominations must be made by members of the CDOC and should highlight innovative and tenacious personnel and teams driving worthy improvements within the Federal Data community.
