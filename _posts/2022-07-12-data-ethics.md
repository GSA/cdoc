In March, the Chief Data Officer Council (CDOC) voted to establish a Data Ethics and Equity Working Group (DEEWG) in order to help the council understand, foster, and support data ethics and data equity activities across the Federal Government. The DEEWG was chartered with twoÂ  main goals in mind: stewarding the [Data Ethics framework]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/documents/fds-data-ethics-framework.pdf) in partnership with other councils, and creating greater Data Equity inside the Federal Data space.

The Data Ethics and Equity Working Group will accomplish these goals through the following activities:

- Goal 1 - Data Ethics Framework
    - Collaborate with ICSP and others to update the framework
    - Promote the use of the framework (e.g., discussion sessions, use cases)
    - Data Ethics Playbook
    - Identify data ethics training needs (potential collaboration with Data Skills WG)

- Goal 2 - Data Equity
    - Identify and share resources developed by agencies and partners (e.g., discussion sessions, blog posts)
    - Support data sharing of key data sources to support equity analysis (potential collaboration with Data Sharing WG)
    - Identify equity analysis skills development opportunities
