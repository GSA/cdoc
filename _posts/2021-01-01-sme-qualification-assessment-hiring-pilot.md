The CDO Council partnered with the US Digital Service, OPM and 10 participating agencies to conduct a cross-agency hiring action for data scientists. A joint announcement garnered a lot of interest, reaching a 500-applicant limit in less than 48 hours to fill over 50 data science positions through a single application. With this process, Subject Matter Experts from participating agencies partnered with OPM to develop competency-based qualifications for the position. SMEs then conducted resume reviews and structured interviews to determine qualified applicants. Hiring managers government-wide with competitive slots will be able to make selections from the shared certificate for up to one year.
