As we embrace the dawn of a new year, we are thrilled to usher in a wave of change and innovation within our community. With renewed energy and a sense of purpose, we proudly introduce the arrival of our esteemed new leadership to our Executive Committee. These new members will collaborate to provide strategic guidance and oversee all activities of the Council, including identifying potential priorities, developing meeting agendas, and promoting collaboration. They will also provide recommendations to the CDO Council on operations proposals including the creation or completion of working groups and the approval of reports or other documents for publication.

For the first time since the Council's inception, we welcome a new Chair and Vice Chair as our fearless leaders! We warmly welcome **Kirsten Dalboe** of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission as the CDO Council Chair and **Rob King** of the Department of Energy as CDO Council's Vice Chair.

Piloting the Data Inventory Working Group is **Austin Gerig** of the Securities Exchange Commission. **Ren Essene** of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is leading the Small Agency Committee.  The Data Sharing Working Group will remain operationalized under Health and Human Services, led by their new CDO, **Dr. Mahnaz Dean**. We are looking forward to seeing the efforts of these members as they work to advance the goals of the CDO Council.

The Council's prosperity relies on the invaluable contributions of its members.

A warm welcome to our latest leaders, and a heartfelt gratitude to those steadfastly serving and advancing the Council.
