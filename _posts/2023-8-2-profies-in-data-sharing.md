The Federal CDO Council’s Data Sharing Working Group is highlighting successful data sharing activities to recognize mature data sharing practices as well as to incentivize and inspire others to take part in similar collaborations. We are excited to share US Citizenship and Immigration Services’ (USCIS) success enhancing contact tracing in a public health emergency. This Profile in Data Sharing focuses on how USCIS collaborated with the Centers for Disease Control to notify state, local, tribal, and territorial public health authorities so they can connect with individuals in their communities about their potential exposure.
