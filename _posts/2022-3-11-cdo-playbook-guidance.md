The CDO Council has released the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/documents/CDO_Playbook_2021.pdf">Chief Data Officer (CDO) Playbook</a> to help CDOs act as key value drivers as the federal government expands its use of data as a strategic asset. It provides new and existing CDOs with guiding principles, opportunities for quick wins, and best practices to navigate some of the key areas that CDOs should focus on today and over the next few years. The CDO Council’s <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/data-skills/">Data Skills Working Group</a> developed the playbook to serve as advice to other CDOs by highlighting the following four key “plays” which draw from successful practices in both industry and government.

- **Play #1:** Cultivate strong relationships to partner on solving mission problems with data.
- **Play #2:** Promote data sharing and break organizational silos.
- **Play #3:** Build a data-driven culture by taking the lead to improve data literacy and acumen within your agency.
- **Play #4:** Drive transformation through a mission focused data and analytics strategy that can influence the enterprise-wide business strategy and  answer key agency questions.

The playbook leverages and cites examples from federal CDOs on how they have applied specific strategies and approaches to make progress in each play to deliver value in this evolving role as a change management leader.
