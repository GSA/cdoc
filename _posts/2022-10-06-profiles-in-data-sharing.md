The Federal CDO Council's Data Sharing Working Group has started a new project to highlight successful data sharing activities. The first [Profile in Data Sharing](https://resources.data.gov/resources/profiles-in-data-sharing/) focuses on a collaboration between the Consumer Product Safety Commission and the Centers for Disease Control on the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System so that it includes all types and causes of injuries.
This enables the calculation of national estimates of injuries treated in emergency departments. Check out the profile to learn more!
