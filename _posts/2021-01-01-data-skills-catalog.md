As part of the FDS 2020 Action Plan, the General Services Administration (GSA) committed to complete <strong>Action 13: Develop a Curated Data Skills Catalog (Catalog)</strong> and <strong>Action 14: Develop a Data Ethics Framework (Framework).</strong>


<ul>
    <li>The <a href="https://resources.data.gov/assets/documents/fds-data-skills-catalog.pdf"> Catalog</a>  can be used to help agencies develop competencies for managing data as a strategic asset and making data-driven decisions.</li>
    <li>The <a href="https://resources.data.gov/assets/documents/fds-data-ethics-framework.pdf">Framework</a> can be used by federal leaders and data users as they make ethical decisions when acquiring, managing, and using data to support their agency’s mission.</li>
</ul>

The Catalog will be maintained by the Chief Data Officers (CDO) Council, while the Framework will be reviewed and updated by the CDO Council and Interagency Council on Statistical Policy (ICSP) every 24 months.

<strong>SME Qualification Assessments hiring pilot closes in less than 2 days</strong>

CDO Council in partnership with USDS and 10 participating agencies recently conducted a hiring action for data scientists. A joint announcement garnered a lot of interest, reaching a 500-applicant limit in less than 48 hours to fill about 50 data science positions through a single application. With this process, SMEs from participating agencies partnered with HR to develop competency-based qualifications for the position. SMEs then conducted resume reviews and structured interviews to determine qualified applicants. Hiring managers government-wide with competitive slots can make selections from the shared certificate for up to one year.
