**Overview:**

The Chief Data Officer Council (CDOC) established a Data Sharing Working Group (DSWG) to help the council understand the varied data-sharing needs and challenges of all agencies across the Federal Government. The DSWG reviewed data-sharing across federal agencies and developed a set of recommendations for improving the methods to access and share data within and between agencies. This [report ](https://resources.data.gov/resources/2021_DSWG%20Recommendations_and_Findings_508/)presents the findings of the DSWG's review and provides recommendations to the CDO Council Executive Committee.

**Recommendations**

Recommendation 1 -- Expedited Agreement Process: One of the key requirements in sharing data across the federal government is the establishment of data use agreements (DUAs) between the owner and/or data custodian and the party requesting access. Improving this process will allow a DUA to be more efficient and timelier and is critical for improving data-sharing across the federal government.
- 1A) Build a collection of agency templates and standard clauses that can be used to draft DUAs.
- 1B) Develop an agreement building tool that can be used to draft DUAs
- 1C) Implement agency-level repositories to maintain copies of existing agreements between agencies.
- 1D) Develop a framework for establishing agreements.
- 1E) Establish an advisory body for data-sharing stalemates.

Recommendation 2 -- Improved Data Awareness: There is insufficient visibility of the data that are available from each government agency and which of those data can be shared across the federal government.
- 2A) Reinforce Data.gov as the government-wide metadata inventory that can be used to discover what data sets are available across the federal government.
- 2B) Create and adopt a data classification mechanism that will help with the identification of data that can be shared and in addition can mark data with existing security classification schemes.
- 2C) Draft a data-sharing infrastructure playbook that will guide federal government agencies as they start to build data-sharing infrastructures.
- 2D) Create a recognition mechanism to incentivize sharing.

Recommendation 3 -- Improved Data Trustworthiness: There is no standard application of methods for collecting data or evaluating data quality.
- 3A) Perform periodic data quality control reviews.
- 3B) Perform pre and post-data quality reviews to ensure data standards and practices are followed.

Recommendation 4 -- Establish the OCDO as the Central Source of Information: In addition to the three high-level recommendation categories, several general recommendations for agency CDOs emerged which would benefit data-sharing.
- 4A) OCDO will serve as the main point of contact for all information related to data-sharing.
- 4B) CDOs should establish data-sharing centers of excellence within agencies.
