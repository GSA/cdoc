The Federal Chief Data Officers Council (CDOC) is proud to announce the production and distribution of its first official podcast. Titled “Unstructured Data,” the podcast will feature federal agency chief data officers and other senior agency officials discussing their work to leverage the power of data and improve how the Federal Government delivers critical services to citizens.

The podcast is hosted by Ted Kaouk, Chair of the CDOC. His first guest, Dan Morgan, is the Chief Data Officer (CDO) at the Department of Transportation (DOT), and vice chair of the CDOC. As the CDO at the DOT since 2014, Dan is the longest-serving CDO in the Federal Government, giving him a unique perspective on the role of CDOs and the power of data in government.

Dan begins by explaining the mission of the DOT and how data supports that mission, which includes transportation safety, investments, and operations. He then describes his role as a CDO and examines the growth and significance of data, not only at the DOT, but in cross-agency functions.

Ted and Dan then examine the Evidence Act, which requires all federal agencies to establish CDOs and make a positive impact on the growing data community in government, and how it interacts with the private sector data community for the benefit of all.

Finally, Dan talks about the advantages of a data career in government, and what skill sets would help candidates be a success.
