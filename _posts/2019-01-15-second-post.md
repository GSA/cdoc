Announcing the relaunch of a new <a href = "https://resources.data.gov/">resources.data.gov</a>, an online repository of policies, tools, case studies, and other resources to support data governance, management, exchange, and use throughout the federal government. The site is a joint effort of OMB, the Office of Government Information Services of the National Archives, and GSA, as required by the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/115/plaws/publ435/PLAW-115publ435.pdf">OPEN Government Data Act</a>, Title II of the Foundations for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act. This resource promises to become a central hub that gathers, publicizes, and shares high-quality data tools and resources, thereby supporting and amplifying the efforts and products of groups and individual data managers and practitioners across government.
