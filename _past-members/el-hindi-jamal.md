Jamal El-Hindi served as the United States Department of the Treasury’s (Treasury) first agency-wide Chief Data Officer (CDO), on a detail from Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). In this role, he established Treasury’s new Office of the Chief Data Officer and led the vision, design and development of agencywide data and information strategy. The strategy is consistent with the Federal Data Strategy and statutory mandates requiring the treatment of data as a critical asset to ensure better governmental decision making and operations.  

Prior to serving in the Treasury CDO role, Jamal was appointed Deputy Director of FinCEN in May 2015, overseeing FinCEN’s efforts to protect the U.S. financial system from money laundering and other forms of illicit financial activity.  

Jamal arrived at FinCEN in 2006, first serving as Head of the Regulatory Policy and Programs Division, and then as the Associate Director for the Policy Division. Prior to joining FinCEN, Jamal served as the Associate Director for Program Policy and Implementation at Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). In that capacity, he oversaw OFAC’s compliance, licensing, and policy functions after having served four years as an Attorney-Advisor in OFAC’s Office of Chief Counsel. 

Before joining Treasury in 2000, Jamal was an associate at Patton Boggs LLP in Washington, D.C., where his practice focused on U.S. regulation of international business transactions, representation of foreign sovereigns, and international banking litigation. He is a graduate of the University of Michigan Law School and Rackham Graduate School; the London School of Economics and Political Science; and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
