Kshemendra Paul was appointed the United States Department of Energy’s (DOE) Assistant Inspector General for Cybersecurity Assessments and Data Analytics in November 2022. His prior role was Chief Data Officer (CDO) for the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). As VA’s CDO, Kshemendra led data governance, management, and analytics to inform VA-wide decision making and provide an authoritative clearinghouse for the collection, analysis, and dissemination of information about Veterans and VA programs. One of his key successes was delivering a Veteran-centric enterprise information model based on interoperable data management to improve evidence-based policymaking as well as frontline operational decision support.

Kshemendra previously served as the Cloud Action Officer for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and coordinated efforts to migrate information technology assets to the cloud management platforms. From 2010 to 2016, he led terrorism-related information sharing from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, successfully integrating a million officers into a nationwide information sharing environment. He worked closely with federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial partners as well as private sector and international allies to balance the needs for information sharing and safeguarding to enhance national security and protect the American people.

Kshemendra began his federal service in 2005 as the chief enterprise architect at the Department of Justice (DOJ) where he led the delivery of the premier public sector semantic interoperability framework, the National Information Exchange Model. From that position, he served as the Federal Chief Architect in the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) where he led federal enterprise architecture activities. His tenure spanned two administrations, four budgets and an $80 billion portfolio.

Prior to joining the federal government, Kshemendra worked in entrepreneurial, technology development, and leadership roles. He received his Master of Science in Electrical Engineering and Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering and Mathematics from the University of Maryland, College Park.
