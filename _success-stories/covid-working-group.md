The CDO Council’s COVID-19 Coordination Working Group developed the Getting Started Guide to support the Federal Government’s COVID-19 related analytic efforts, frameworks, methodologies, and other relevant knowledge. The guide focuses on work performed by members of the working group regarding reopening efforts across federal agencies and how data and analytics augmented their decision making processes.

The Getting Started Guide is a reference tool to assist agencies in the effective use of data and analytics to support their COVID-19 tracking plans and reopening efforts. The guide showcases interagency products, shares lessons learned, and helps to identify new and useful data sources. The content found in this document seeks to facilitate collaboration and knowledge sharing and promotes a government-wide approach to making data-informed decisions on COVID-19 impacts, tracking, and reopening plans.
