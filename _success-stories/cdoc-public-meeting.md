The CDOCâ€™s first year of operations saw numerous working groups and pilot projects established to great success. The public meeting, held October, 14 2021 served as an update and informational resource on these actions for the general public. Several working groups as well as CDOs from both CFO-Act and non CFO-Act agencies spoke about their priorities and operations with the public before the Evidence Act Councils discussed the numerous collaborations which the CDOC enabled during its initial year of operations. Sharing this information with the public as well as introducing the Request For Information process provided a clear and transparent accounting of the CDOCs efforts while providing the public with information about its priorities and goals moving forwards.
