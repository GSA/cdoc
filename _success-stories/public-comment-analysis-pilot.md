    The CDOC worked with multiple agencies to test how state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques could help agencies analyze public comments. This <a href="https://resources.data.gov/assets/documents/CDOC_Recommendations_Report_Comment_Analysis_FINAL.pdf">pilot</a> created a proof-of-concept tool for helping agencies find insights, efficiency, and cost savings in their comment analysis.

In the process of lawmaking many agencies and bureaus need to review and incorporate all comments received in review. The number of comments as well as their variance can make this a time consuming and resource heavy task despite its repetitive nature. The CDOC’s <a href="https://resources.data.gov/assets/documents/CDOC_Recommendations_Report_Comment_Analysis_FINAL.pdf">pilot program</a> used cutting edge NLP technologies to create a standardized tool which not only saves time and money, but additionally allows agencies and bureaus to find more value in every comment analyzed. The tool’s neural network allows comments to be grouped by general content while also allowing for customization at an agency level. Additionally, the tool recognizes topics and themes while also noting duplicates and semantically similar comments. This analysis gives agencies better insight and greater efficiency as they continue their daily operations.
