    The CDO Council worked with the US Department of Agriculture, the Department of the Treasury, the United States Agency for International Development, and the Department of Transportation to develop a Diversity Profile Dashboard and a <a href="https://resources.data.gov/resources/CDO_HR_Dashboard/">report</a> to explore the value of shared HR decision support across agencies.

The CDO Council developed a Diversity Profile dashboard displaying data from the US Department of Agriculture, the Department of the Treasury, the United States Agency for International Development, and the Department of Transportation. The CDO Council recognized an opportunity to analyze how sharing decision support tools across agencies could offer significant value. This pilot project demonstrated how multiple agencies might be able to visualize their HR data in a standardized dashboard and inform best practices for advancing federal data analytics. The Council also developed a <a href="https://resources.data.gov/resources/CDO_HR_Dashboard/">report</a> that explores key takeaways from the pilot and recommendations for government-wide implementation, as well as the benefits and challenges of this solution, alternatives, and future considerations. It also demonstrated that tools like these might offer value by supporting novel insights and visualizations; reducing duplicative development efforts across government; and ultimately realizing cost savings for agencies and the broader US Government.
