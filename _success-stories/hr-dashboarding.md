The CDO Council developed a Diversity Profile dashboard displaying data from the US Department of Agriculture, the Department of the Treasury, the United States Agency for International Development, and the Department of Transportation. The CDO Council recognized an opportunity to analyze how sharing decision support tools across agencies could offer significant value. Development of a proof-of-concept dashboard demonstrated how multiple agencies might be able to visualize their HR data in a standardized dashboard and inform best practices for advancing federal data analytics.

This report explores key takeaways from the pilot and recommendations for government-wide implementation of a similar solution, as well as the benefits and challenges of this solution, alternatives, and future considerations. This effort supports the Executive Order on Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government as well as the Executive Order on Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility in the Federal Workforce. It also demonstrated that tools like these might offer value by supporting novel insights and visualizations; reducing duplicative development efforts across government; and ultimately realizing cost savings for agencies and the broader US Government.
