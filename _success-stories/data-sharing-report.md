The Chief Data Officers Council (CDOC) established the Data Sharing Working Group (DSWG) to help the council better understand the ever evolving nature of data-sharing needs as well as the data-sharing challenges facing all agencies across the Federal Government. The DSWG subsequently studied those specifics across a variety of CFO-Act and non CFO-Act agencies, before collecting their findings to create four key procedural and logistical recommendations for federal agencies which can be found in the <a href="https://resources.data.gov/resources/2021_DSWG%20Recommendations_and_Findings_508/">report</a>.
