The CDO Council’s Data Skills Working Group created this <a href="https://resources.data.gov/assets/documents/CDO_Playbook_2021.pdf">playbook</a> of four key “plays” to help CDOs be key value drivers as the federal government expands its use of data as a strategic asset. It is advice from CDOs to other CDOs that draws from successful practices in both industry and government. The Playbook leverages and cites concrete examples from federal CDOs on how they have applied specific strategies and approaches to make progress in each play to deliver value in this evolving role as a change management leader. It also shares commonalities that may exist among people, process, technology, and data factors in different agencies.
