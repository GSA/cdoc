The CDO Council’s Data Skills Working Group created this <a href="https://resources.data.gov/assets/documents/CDO_Playbook_2021.pdf">playbook</a> of four key “plays” which draw from successful practices in both industry and government. It is advice from CDOs to other CDOs. The Playbook leverages and cites concrete examples from federal CDOs on how they have applied specific strategies and approaches to make progress in each play to deliver value in this evolving role as a change management leader. The goal of this playbook is to help CDOs be key value drivers as the federal government expands its use of data as a strategic asset. The information provided unearthed commonalities among people, process, technology, and data distinctions prevalent in many agencies. This Playbook is meant to be illustrative and insightful for recognizing value-based opportunities for any agency.
