    The CDOC’s Data Inventory Working Group created a <a href="https://resources.data.gov/resources/CDOC_Data_Inventory_Report/">report</a> to highlight the value proposition for data inventories and describe challenges agencies may face when implementing and managing comprehensive data inventories. Additionally, the report identifies the ways all agencies can overcome these challenges and includes a set of recommendations directed towards Agencies, OMB, and the CDO Council.

Data inventories are an essential part of good data governance. These inventories enable agencies and clients to efficiently find, access and use data assets. They also allow managers to evaluate the ways in which data helps their agency (or others) meet their mission goals. The Data Inventory Working group’s <a href="https://resources.data.gov/resources/CDOC_Data_Inventory_Report/">report</a> is designed to ensure that each agency’s data inventory helps them towards these ends. Composed of a series of case studies, the report ultimately resulted in a series of recommendations to OMB, the CDOC, CDOC Working Groups, and Agencies themselves about how to emphasize the internal value of data inventories, as well as data literacy, and data inventory procedures. These recommendations have helped to inform data inventory and management across many agencies and continue to guide procedure and progress today.
