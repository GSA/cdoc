The <a href="https://resources.data.gov/resources/data_skills_training_program_implementation_toolkit/">Data Skills Training Program Implementation Toolkit</a> has been developed through an analysis of successful data skills training programs at eleven different federal agencies and interagency council groups. To develop this Toolkit, The Data Skills Working Group interviewed agencies and inter-agency council groups with data skills training programs to document their implementation journey, including lessons learned and best practices. The interviews also captured challenges, key stakeholders, and future strategies for these programs. This Toolkit has seven key steps to help agencies implement their own training programs and navigate implementation roadblocks they might encounter.
