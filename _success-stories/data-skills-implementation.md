The <a href="https://resources.data.gov/assets/documents/Data_Skills_Training_Program_Implementation_Toolkit_Finalv1.pdf">Data Skills Training Program Implementation Toolkit</a> has been developed through an analysis of successful data skills training programs at eleven different federal agencies and interagency council groups. To develop this Toolkit, agencies and inter-agency council groups with data skills training programs were interviewed to capture their implementation journey, including lessons learned and best practices. The interviews also captured challenges, key stakeholders, and future strategies for the eleven programs. This Toolkit has seven key steps to help agencies implement their own training programs and navigate implementation roadblocks they might encounter.
