    In 2021, the CDOC conducted a <a href="https://resources.data.gov/resources/Fuels_Knowledge_Graph_Project/">pilot project</a> to explore the use of knowledge graphs to achieve more consistent and reliable fuel management performance measures. The data was drawn from a variety of different agencies and their collaboration improved land manager insight and effectiveness while serving as a foundation for future collaboration in the wildland fire community.

One of the most powerful tools used to fight deadly wildland fires is land management. Land managers can carefully control and remove potential fuel for wildland fires in order to reduce risk. However, understanding how effective fuel management strategies are can be difficult, as wildland fires take place in a variety of different regions and biomes with a multitude of variables. The CDOCâ€™s <a href="https://resources.data.gov/resources/Fuels_Knowledge_Graph_Project/">pilot project</a> addressed this unique challenge by employing a knowledge graph, which took existing data about fuel projects and linked the data elements to uncover new insights about fuel and risk management. The data was drawn from a variety of different agencies and their collaboration improved land manager insight and effectiveness while serving as a foundation for future collaboration in the wildland fire community.
