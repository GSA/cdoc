This Memorandum directs agencies to leverage and continue to employ existing financial transparency and accountability mechanisms wherever possible. In balancing speed with transparency, agencies are to consider the three core principles below:

- Mission achievement - Federal managers and recipients at all levels should use data and evidence to achieve program objectives;
- Expediency - Agencies should rapidly issue awards and fund programs to meet crucial needs;and
- Transparency and accountability - Agencies must report information on awards to provide the public with information in a clear, accurate, and timely manner.
