## [The Federal Data Strategy](https://strategy.data.gov/overview/)

Provides a common set of data principles and best practices in implementing data innovations that drive more value for the public. Annual action plans will
identify and prioritize practice-related steps for a given year, along with targeted timeframes and responsible entities.

The 2020 Action Plan establishes a solid foundation that will support implementation of the strategy over the next decade. Specifically, the plan identifies initial actions for agencies that are essential for establishing processes, building capacity, and aligning existing efforts to better leverage data as a strategic asset.
